                        <p>
                            HUMANITY FOUNDATION is a not-for-profit organisation working in India for 20 years, focusing
                            on alleviating poverty and social injustice. We do this through well planned and
                            comprehensive projects in health, education, livelihoods and disaster preparedness and
                            response. Our overall goal is the empowerment of women and girls from poor and marginalised
                            communities leading to improvement in their lives and livelihoods. </p>
                        <p>
                            During FY 2019-20, We directly reached out to 10.4 million people directly through 53
                            projects across 19 states, covering more than 90 districts. We are working in 100 countries
                            for a world where all people live with
                            dignity and security.

                            running through this new crisis. Even with travel restrictions and lockdowns, we’re in some
                            of the hardest to reach places ensuring children and their families receive the vital care
                            they need. </p>

                        <p>This is especially true in Uganda, where the government’s strict lockdown banned the use of
                            public transport – including ‘boda’ motorbikes, which many people rely on to travel. For
                            rural communities, this made accessing vital services – markets and healthcare facilities,
                            for example – a real struggle. </p>

                        <p>Due to lockdown and fear of coronavirus, there has been a reduction in the number of pregnant
                            women accessing ANC (antenatal care) check-ups and delivering babies in health centres. In
                            the last quarter, the team have delivered 55 babies and delivered family planning, ANC and
                            PNC check-ups, and immunisation of children.</p>

                        <p>We work for children who are orphaned, abandoned or whose families are unable to care for
                            them. We give these children the opportunity to build lasting relationships within a family.
                            Our family approach in the SOS Children's Village is based on four principles: Each child
                            needs a mother, and grows up most naturally with brothers and sisters, in their own house,
                            within a supportive village environment.</p>

                        <h3>We Help them Shape their Own Futures</h3>
                        <p>We enable children to live according to their own culture and religion, and to be active
                            members of the community. We help children to recognise and express their individual
                            abilities, interests and talents. We ensure that children receive the education and skills
                            training they need to be successful and contributing members of society.</p>

                            vulnerable children and young people.
                            We establish facilities and programmes that aim to strengthen families and prevent the
                            abandonment of children.
                            We join hands with community members to provide education and health care, and respond to
                            emergencies.</p>
