                        <p>
                            COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways. It's caused by a virus
                            called coronavirus. It was discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath
                            and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe
                            acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering
                            mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close
                            contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

                                <h4>Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019?</h4>
                                <p>There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild
                                    upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused be a novel (or

                                    coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. The name of this disease

                                <h4>How can people help stop stigma related to COVID-19?</h4>
                                <p>People can fight stigma and help, not hurt, others by providing social support.

                                    stigma by learning and sharing facts. Communicating the facts that viruses do not

                                    is
                                    associated with a lack of knowledge about how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame
                                    someone,
                                    fears about disease and death, and gossip that spreads rumors and myths.Stigma hurts
                                    everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the
                                    disease that
                                    is causing the problem.</p>
